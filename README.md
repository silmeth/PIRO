The aim of the project is to detect different geometric shapes (circle, rectangle, triangle, octagon) printed on a sheet of paper. Program downloads video stream from Android cellphone using [IPWebCam](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam). Sheet is detected and image is transformed to include only white background and figures. After figures are detected, their positions are saved. After that, user's fingertip is detected and tracked. If it hovers over any picture, it changes it's color.
